# React Advanced Patterns

## Compound Pattern

We can use Compound pattern to arrange the order of the children. Compound pattern let developers visualize and reorder the children of a compound component. Think of compound components like the ``<select>`` and ``<option>`` elements in HTML.

Use this when:

- A component containing some other component and the children order can be adjusted
- There are some state that can be implicitly affected to children components
